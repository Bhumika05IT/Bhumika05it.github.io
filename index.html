<h1>
        Part Ordering API and Dashboard
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Part Ordering API is built using C#, .NET Core, and SQL, while the Dashboard is developed using C#, .NET Core, Blazor Server, SQL, and Azure DevOps.
        The company's repair warehouse processes 2,000 to 3,000 laptops and tablets daily. In the previous repair process, technicians had to order missing parts using a legacy COBOL application, which had several limitations. The application could accept input but did not provide real-time database updates or show the availability of ordered parts.
        After placing an order, the warehouse team manually checked the availability of each required part. If all parts were available, they would assemble the package; if any item was missing, the package was placed on a separate rack, causing delays.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Improvements with the New System
    </h2>
    <p>
        The new system enhances the procurement process, improves warehouse operations, and provides repair technicians with real-time order status updates. It makes the repair workflow more efficient, predictable, and organized, reducing processing time by 30%.
        Automation is achieved through a .NET Core background thread, which processes pending orders as soon as parts become available.
