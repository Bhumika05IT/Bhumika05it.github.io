            <h2>Project Descriptions</h2>
            <p><strong>Part Ordering API and Dashboard:</strong></p>
            <p>The Part Ordering API is built using C#, .NET Core, and SQL, while the Dashboard is developed using C#, .NET Core, Blazor Server, SQL, and Azure DevOps.</p>
            <p>The company's repair warehouse processes 2,000 to 3,000 laptops and tablets daily. Previously, technicians had to order missing parts using a legacy COBOL application, which had several limitations. The application could accept input but did not provide real-time database updates or show the availability of ordered parts.</p>
            <p>After placing an order, the warehouse team manually checked the availability of each required part. If all parts were available, they would assemble the package; if any item was missing, the package was placed on a separate rack, causing delays.</p>
            <h4>Improvements with the New System</h4>
            <p>The new system enhances the procurement process, improves warehouse operations, and provides repair technicians with real-time order status updates. It makes the repair workflow more efficient, predictable, and organized, reducing processing time by 30%.</p>
            <p>Automation is achieved through a .NET Core background thread, which processes pending orders as soon as parts become available.</p>
            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integration with Dell’s API:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fetches details such as pricing and supplier information.</li>
                        <li>Selects the correct parts based on stakeholder requirements.</li>
                        <li>Sends a request to Dell’s API when parts are required for a motherboard repair.</li>
                        <li>Notifies the warehouse procurement team to manually post orders to Dell’s API when necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dashboard Functionalities:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows users to mark orders as processing, ready for delivery, delivered, or posted.</li>
                        <li>Generates a pick ticket with a barcode for all orders with available parts.</li>
                        <li>Displays bin numbers for easy part retrieval.</li>
                        <li>Enables warehouse runners to scan and verify orders using employee badge IDs before final delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>My Responsibilities</h4>
            <ul>
